        The degree to which a coffee bean is roasted is one of the most important factors that determine the taste of the coffee. Unroasted beans (green in color) are put into a roaster and exposed to a high level of heat. When the bean “cracks,” it loses its outer coating and releases the flavor of the bean. The longer the bean roasts, the darker and stronger the bean becomes. When the roasting is complete, the beans can be blended and ground to create distinct flavors and brews

    <p style="width: 50%;">
        Colombian coffee is coffee that is grown in Colombia. Colombian coffee tends to demand a higher price because it is mostly made up of the superior arabica variety. Colombian coffees can have heavy notes of chocolate and nuts, or lighter fruit and floral notes, depending on which department it’s grown.
